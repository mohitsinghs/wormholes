- Scalable and Distributed
- Highly Customizable
- High Performance
- API Access

## Why ?

There are a lot of link-shorteners out there, open-source and commercial. they provide easy access to resources in diverse fields. It's an easy problem to solve until it's not.

When I witnessed how a quick in-house implementation can cost a business and will refuse to scale, I was curious on how to scale these reliably. When a quick lookup didn't help me find any solution, I decided to write my own. I've detailed about this [here](https://mohitsingh.in/building-a-link-shortner) and [here](https://mohitsingh.in/a-distributed-link-shortner).

## Getting started

Everything required to get started with Wormholes is in [wiki](https://github.com/mohitsinghs/wormholes/wiki).

## Behind the name

Wormholes are tunnels made by earthworms and a link between two disparate points in spacetime. Short links are essentially a links to digital thing. This project is inspired by both and hence named after them.

## Having problems ?

Feel free to open an issue or feature request. I'll try to help you as long as you really care about open source and are being reasonable.
